# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile/compare/v0.0.0...v0.1.0) (2020-01-18)

Moved project into the sile-typesetter namespace. At this point the toolkit is pretty mature and has been used for a couple dozen production projects and works for unmodified across all of them. It is very picky about how things are setup in the project and not very easy to get started with.

## [0.0.0](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/casile/compare/7d2cc11...v0.0.0) (2017-01-19)

Add first release tag just to document the state of affaris. At this point the toolkit has been used for several production projects, but always with a good deal of fiddling for each one.
